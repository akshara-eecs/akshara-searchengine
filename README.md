# Ask Akshara - a Search Engine Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a scalable search engine inspired by platforms like Google or Bing. The search engine is capable of efficiently indexing and retrieving information from web pages, leveraging advanced techniques in information retrieval and scalable infrastructure.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Parallel Processing:** MapReduce (Hadoop)
- **Data Structures:** Inverted Index, PageRank
- **Web Technologies:** REST API, JSON
- **Concurrency:** Multithreading

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Implementing core information retrieval concepts such as tf-idf and PageRank.
- Designing scalable and efficient data pipelines using MapReduce.
- Developing a Service-Oriented Architecture for dynamic web applications.
- Optimizing performance through multithreading and concurrent programming.

## How It Works
1. **Crawling:** The web crawler gathers pages for indexing.
2. **Indexing:** The inverted index pipeline processes pages, generating a segmented index.
3. **Ranking:** PageRank assigns relevance scores to pages.
4. **Querying:** The Index Server retrieves results based on user queries, formatted as JSON.
5. **Presentation:** The Search Server presents top 10 results in a clean, user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates the integration of information retrieval, parallel processing, and user-centered design to create a functional and scalable search engine.
