# Ask Akshara - a Search Engine Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a scalable search engine inspired by platforms like Google or Bing. The search engine efficiently indexes and retrieves information from web pages, leveraging advanced techniques in information retrieval and scalable infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Inverted Index:** Developed a segmented inverted index pipeline for efficient text search and retrieval.
- **PageRank Algorithm:** Implemented link analysis using PageRank to rank search results based on importance and relevance.
- **MapReduce Framework:** Utilized MapReduce (Hadoop) for scalable and parallel data processing.
- **Multithreading:** Employed multithreaded techniques to optimize the performance of various components.
- **Crawler:** Built a web crawler to gather and preprocess data for indexing.
- **REST API:** Created an Index Server with a REST API that returns search results in JSON format.
- **Search Server:** Designed a user-friendly interface mimicking the functionality of popular search engines.

## Future Work

- **Improved Ranking Algorithms:** Explore machine learning approaches for ranking.
- **Advanced Crawling Techniques:** Handle dynamic and multimedia content.
- **Scalability:** Extend to larger datasets and distributed environments.

This project demonstrates the integration of information retrieval, parallel processing, and user-centered design to create a functional and scalable search engine.
